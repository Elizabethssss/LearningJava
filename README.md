# LearningJava
This repository constitutes a challenge in my road to learning Java and its source of inspiration is [proglib](https://proglib.io/p/project-list/) article. There are 90+ tasks for beginners and their implementation, which can be solved in any programming language. Projects are divided into several categories. Below you can see my realisations of these small projects.
# Numbers
[00_Find PI to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/Elizabethssss/TrainingJava/blob/master/00) - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

[01_Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/Elizabethssss/TrainingJava/blob/master/01) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number (starts from 0).
